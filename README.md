#NeuroPC: a linux-based x86 kernel for Organic_CPUs, is extending the horizon beyond-belief of what we know about the human-brain, and neurotechnology by defining another reality-layer in the form of biophysical-existence.
 
By allowing computer-operations to be run simultaneously with reality.os software-systems, and neuromorphic/isomorphic platforms, devices, and programs for a variety of uses;
Which are-designed for maximum ai-assistance with augmented-capabilities, and daily-tasks to exercise the brain for improving intelligence, expanding/sharing knowledge, and developing, and growing together, forming a community of developers to create civilized, and ethical projects.
