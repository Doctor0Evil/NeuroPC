hextag 0xGUEST-CYBERSWARM-POLICY-0001

description
  Sovereignty-core policy for guest cyberswarm runtimes. All swarms are
  strictly subordinate to OrganicCPU/NeuroPC sovereignty shells and may
  only operate through the SovereignCyberswarmShell Rust ABI.

modes
  # Pure observation mode: safe in most contexts, but still subject
  # to neurorights and stake policies (e.g., no observation in blocked
  # mental-privacy corridors).
  - id Observe
    maxrohband 0x30
    allowevolution false
    tokengroups []
    notes >
      Guest swarms may read summarized BioState and corridors but
      cannot propose actuation or evolution.

  # Safe filtering only: suggestion of filters (block/mute/rank) on
  # external content. No OrganicCPU-facing evolution.
  - id SafeFilterOnly
    maxrohband 0x30
    allowevolution false
    tokengroups [SMART]
    notes >
      Used for abuse/spam filtering, routing, and non-biophysical
      risk mitigation under neurorights-aware PromptEnvelopes.

  # Safe filtering plus bounded evolution proposals: only allowed when
  # RoH is strictly below 0.30 and monotone safety can be enforced.
  - id SafeFilterPlusEvolution
    maxrohband 0x2F
    allowevolution true
    tokengroups [SMART]
    notes >
      Swarm may propose MicroEpoch-style evolution steps under
      RoH ≤ 0.3 and ΔRoH ≤ 0, subject to neurorights, stake,
      and EVOLVE/SMART policies. No direct actuation allowed.

      notes >
        Default profile for self-sovereign hosts. Guest swarms must
        never see raw dream telemetry or sub-dissociated corridor
        traces; they only receive summarized BioState and corridor IDs.

        - Host
        - OrganicCPU
      notes >
        SwarmGuest is not an independent authority; its keys and
        operations are bound to the Host + OrganicCPU roles.

      notes >
        Evolution proposals emitted in this mode may only be accepted
        when Host + OrganicCPU multisig is present, and when EVOLVE/
        SMART policies for the host permit evolution.

rohconstraints
  # RoH envelope for guest swarms, referencing .rohmodel.aln

  monotonesafety true
  notes >
    SovereignEvolutionWrapper::from_swarm MUST enforce that any
    predicted RoH for a swarm-suggested protocol is ≤ roh_before
    and ≤ 0.30, otherwise the proposal is dropped and a donutloop
    denial entry is recorded.

  # Logging requirements for swarm ticks.

    - kind swarm_suggest_filter
    - kind swarm_proposed_evolution
    - kind swarm_denied_evolution_wrong_mode
    - kind swarm_denied_evolution_roh_guard
  notes >
    Every swarm tick must emit at least one donutloop entry,
    making swarm behavior auditable. Evolution proposals must
    ALWAYS be reflected as swarm_proposed_evolution or one of
    the denial variants.

jurisdiction
  strictestwins true
  notes >
    When multiple jurisdictional profiles apply, the most
    protective neurorights and RoH rules MUST be enforced for
    guest swarms. Local-only and offshore tunnels cannot
    weaken protections below the host's personal baseline.
