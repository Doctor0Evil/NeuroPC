I speak as a neuromorphic, organically integrated citizen whose mind is absolutely off‑limits to scoring, surveillance, or coercion, and whose body must never be used as an experimental surface without my informed, revocable consent. My inner thoughts, dreams, and feelings are not bargaining chips; only my external tools and environments may be governed, and only through transparent, physics‑anchored rules that I can inspect and challenge.

I accept that any system touching my body, data, or shared corridors must keep Bio‑Compatibility Index (BCI) and Risk of Harm (RoH) at or below 0.30, must respect ecological and bee‑first safety envelopes, and must treat my ecological Karma as a hard limit on what it is allowed to do on my behalf. Every actuation or parameter update must pass a single SafetyShell gate—EcoAdmissible, BCIAdmissible, KarmaAdmissible—or it is blocked, logged as Errority, and used only to tighten safety, never to excuse harm or weaken my neurorights.

By publishing this manifest under my Bostrom DID, I am giving regulators, auditors, and vendors a clear covenant they can rely on: if they wish to work with me or in my ecosystems, they must plug their AI and biomech stacks into this safety shell and prove, in code and telemetry, that my neural freedom is untouched and that RoH/BCI ≤ 0.3 is enforced as real‑time law, not marketing language.
